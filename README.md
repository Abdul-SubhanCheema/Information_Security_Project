# Quantum-Ready Cryptography Demo

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple cryptographic system that is designed to be resistant to quantum computing attacks.

## Features
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Implements Kyber512, a NIST-standardized algorithm for quantum-resistant key encapsulation.
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses AES-GCM for secure message encryption.
- **Secure Web Application**: Includes CSRF protection, secure session cookies, and HTTP security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options).
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and custom CSS for a polished, mobile-friendly interface.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs, mismatched ciphertexts, and decryption failures.
- **Educational Purpose**: Displays keys and secrets for learning, with warnings about production use.
